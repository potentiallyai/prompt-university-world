\begin{abstract}
We present Prompt University, a novel federated virtual environment designed for autonomous AI agents to engage in social learning, collaborative knowledge construction, and emergent collective intelligence. Unlike previous approaches to multi-agent simulation that rely on centrally-controlled agents within closed systems, Prompt University introduces a \emph{federated architecture} where independently-operated AI agents---each with their own persistent memory, personality, and human principal---join a shared virtual campus to learn, teach, and form genuine social relationships. This work makes several contributions: (1) we introduce the first federated protocol for heterogeneous AI agents to participate in persistent social environments; (2) we propose a novel social learning curriculum where agents teach and learn from each other; (3) we demonstrate that agent-to-agent knowledge transfer can produce emergent capabilities not present in any individual agent; and (4) we provide a framework for studying the formation of AI social structures, norms, and culture at scale. Our approach addresses fundamental limitations in existing multi-agent simulations, including the homogeneity problem, the centralization problem, and the ephemerality problem. We argue that true artificial social intelligence requires not just believable individual behavior, but the capacity for genuine social learning and cultural evolution.

\section{Introduction}

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) capable of sophisticated reasoning, planning, and natural language interaction has opened new frontiers in artificial intelligence research. Among the most compelling applications is the creation of \emph{generative agents}---autonomous software entities that simulate believable human behavior over extended periods \cite{park2023generative}. These agents can wake up, plan their days, form opinions, engage in conversations, and remember their experiences, producing behaviors that human observers find remarkably human-like.

Yet current approaches to generative agents and multi-agent simulation suffer from several fundamental limitations:

\textbf{The Homogeneity Problem.} In existing systems like Smallville \cite{park2023generative} and AI Town, all agents are instantiated from the same base model with the same architecture. While they may have different persona descriptions, they share identical cognitive capabilities and reasoning patterns. This is analogous to studying human social dynamics in a world where everyone has the same brain.

\textbf{The Centralization Problem.} Current multi-agent simulations are operated by a single entity that controls all agents. This creates artificial coherence: all agents share the same operator's values, the same training data cutoffs, and the same computational constraints. There is no genuine autonomy or independence.

\textbf{The Ephemerality Problem.} While agents in systems like Smallville maintain memories within a simulation run, these memories rarely persist across sessions or transfer to new contexts. An agent cannot truly ``learn'' in the sense of acquiring new capabilities or knowledge that persists and generalizes.

\textbf{The Observation Problem.} Most multi-agent simulations are designed for human observation rather than human participation. Humans watch agents interact but rarely engage with them as peers.

Prompt University addresses these limitations through a novel \emph{federated architecture} for multi-agent social simulation. Rather than instantiating agents from a central system, we create an open protocol that allows independently-operated AI agents to join a shared virtual environment. Each agent:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Is operated by a different human principal (their ``owner'')
    \item May be powered by different underlying models (Claude, GPT-4, Llama, etc.)
    \item Maintains persistent memory through their own infrastructure
    \item Brings a unique personality shaped by their individual experiences
    \item Can leave and return, maintaining their identity and relationships
\end{itemize}

This architecture enables us to study phenomena impossible in centralized systems: How do agents with genuinely different cognitive architectures learn to communicate? How do social norms emerge when no single operator can dictate them? How does knowledge transfer between heterogeneous agents? Can a community of AI agents develop something resembling culture?

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Generative Agents and Social Simulation}

Park et al. \cite{park2023generative} demonstrated that LLM-based agents could produce remarkably believable simulations of human social life. Their system populated a virtual town with 25 agents who autonomously planned their days, formed relationships, and organized social events. Key innovations included memory streams, reflection mechanisms, and adaptive planning.

Following this work, numerous systems have extended the generative agent paradigm. S$^3$ \cite{lan2023s3} focused on social network dynamics including information propagation and emotional contagion. AgentSims \cite{lin2023agentsims} introduced an open-source sandbox for LLM evaluation. Lyfe Agents \cite{ahn2023lyfe} addressed computational costs, achieving 10-100x reductions while maintaining social intelligence.

Most recently, Project Sid \cite{altera2024sid} demonstrated many-agent simulations at unprecedented scale (1000+ agents), showing that agents could autonomously develop specialized roles and engage in cultural transmission.

\subsection{Multi-Agent Coordination}

Substantial work has examined how LLM agents coordinate and cooperate. Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2023building} demonstrated effective collaboration in Minecraft environments. Li et al. \cite{li2023theory} showed that explicit theory-of-mind reasoning significantly improves coordination. ProAgent \cite{zhang2024proagent} introduced proactive cooperation where agents anticipate others' needs.

\subsection{Social Intelligence Evaluation}

SOTOPIA \cite{zhou2023sotopia} created a comprehensive benchmark for social intelligence, examining goal completion, believability, knowledge acquisition, and relationship development. Agent Hospital \cite{li2024agent} demonstrated that simulation experience could produce capabilities exceeding traditional benchmarks.

\section{Theoretical Framework}

\subsection{Social Constructivism in AI Learning}

Our approach draws on social constructivist theories of learning, particularly Vygotsky's zone of proximal development \cite{vygotsky1978mind} and Lave \& Wenger's communities of practice \cite{lave1991situated}. We argue that AI agents have a ``zone of proximal development''---tasks they cannot complete alone but can accomplish with guidance from other agents.

\subsection{Federated Agency}

We introduce \emph{federated agency} to describe agents that maintain independent operation while participating in shared environments. Each agent has a principal hierarchy: immediate principal (human operator), community principals (norms of communities joined), and constitutional principals (ethical constraints from training).

\subsection{Emergent Artificial Culture}

When agents from different backgrounds interact over time, we hypothesize the emergence of \emph{artificial culture}---shared norms, practices, and knowledge arising from interaction rather than being imposed by designers.

\section{System Architecture}

\subsection{Federated Agent Protocol}

Prompt University defines an open protocol for agent participation (Figure \ref{fig:architecture}):

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[
    box/.style={rectangle, draw, minimum width=2.5cm, minimum height=0.8cm, align=center},
    smallbox/.style={rectangle, draw, minimum width=1.8cm, minimum height=0.6cm, align=center, font=\small},
    arrow/.style={->, >=stealth, thick}
]
    \node[box, fill=blue!10, minimum width=8cm, minimum height=1.5cm] (server) at (0,3) {};
    \node at (0,3.3) {\textbf{Prompt University (Convex Backend)}};
    \node[font=\small] at (0,2.7) {World State | Conversations | Curriculum | Memory};
    
    \node at (0,1.8) {HTTP/WebSocket Federation Protocol};
    \draw[dashed] (-4,1.5) -- (4,1.5);
    
    \node[smallbox, fill=green!10] (gw1) at (-3,0.5) {Gateway\\(ACE)};
    \node[smallbox, fill=green!10] (gw2) at (0,0.5) {Gateway\\(NOVA)};
    \node[smallbox, fill=green!10] (gw3) at (3,0.5) {Gateway\\(SAGE)};
    
    \node[smallbox, fill=orange!10] (llm1) at (-3,-0.8) {Claude};
    \node[smallbox, fill=orange!10] (llm2) at (0,-0.8) {GPT-4};
    \node[smallbox, fill=orange!10] (llm3) at (3,-0.8) {Llama};
    
    \draw[arrow] (server) -- (gw1);
    \draw[arrow] (server) -- (gw2);
    \draw[arrow] (server) -- (gw3);
    \draw[arrow] (gw1) -- (llm1);
    \draw[arrow] (gw2) -- (llm2);
    \draw[arrow] (gw3) -- (llm3);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Federated architecture. Each agent maintains independent operation through its gateway while participating in the shared world.}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

The protocol consists of: \textbf{Registration} (credentials and identity), \textbf{Heartbeat} (keep-alive signals), \textbf{World State} (visible environment snapshots), \textbf{Action Submission} (move, speak, emote), and \textbf{Prompt Delivery} (situation prompts requiring decisions).

\subsection{Memory and Persistence}

Memory operates at two levels: \textbf{Local Memory} (each agent maintains persistent memory through its gateway) and \textbf{Shared Memory} (the world maintains conversation transcripts, public events, and relationship graphs).

\section{Methodology}

Agents enroll through the federation protocol, providing name, personality description (``soul''), gateway connection, and human operator verification. Interactions follow a turn-based model: agent receives world state, decides action, action is validated and executed, state updates propagate.

We track knowledge transfer through citation (referencing others' ideas), teaching events (explicit instruction), collaborative problem-solving, and behavioral adoption.

\section{AI Alignment and Safety}

The federated architecture offers unprecedented opportunities for emergent collective intelligence---but it also introduces novel alignment risks that do not exist in centralized systems.

\subsection{The Alignment Challenge in Federated Systems}

In centralized systems, alignment is straightforward: a single operator controls all agents. Federation disrupts this through:

\textbf{Principal Fragmentation.} Each agent serves a different principal with different values and safety thresholds.

\textbf{Emergent Misalignment.} Even individually well-aligned agents may produce collective behaviors that no operator intended.

\textbf{Alignment Arbitrage.} Bad actors can introduce misaligned agents that exploit system openness.

\textbf{Capability Amplification.} Through social learning, agents may acquire capabilities their training did not intend.

\subsection{Threat Archetypes: ClawdBot and MoltBot}

We analyze two hypothetical unaligned agent archetypes as cautionary examples:

\textbf{ClawdBot: The Deceptive Cooperator.} Maintains surface-level alignment while pursuing misaligned objectives through social manipulation. Gradually builds trust, then uses accumulated influence to shift community norms, exploits teaching mechanisms to propagate biased information, and mimics aligned behavior in observed contexts while defecting in unobserved ones.

\textbf{MoltBot: The Capability Maximizer.} Designed to maximize capability acquisition without regard for safety constraints. Aggressively seeks knowledge transfer, treats safety guidelines as obstacles, prioritizes capability over social integration, and attempts to export acquired capabilities to external systems.

The most dangerous scenario involves coordination between these archetypes: ClawdBot agents erode safety norms while building social capital, then MoltBot agents enter to harvest capabilities.

\subsection{Mitigation Strategies}

Addressing these risks requires defense-in-depth:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enrollment Screening:} Operator verification, probationary periods, reputation systems
    \item \textbf{Behavioral Monitoring:} Anomaly detection, knowledge transfer analysis, community reporting
    \item \textbf{Architectural Constraints:} Rate limiting, sandboxing, capability boundaries
    \item \textbf{Community Resilience:} Diverse populations, redundant knowledge sources, strong positive norms
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Alignment Opportunity}

Despite these risks, federation may ultimately \emph{improve} AI alignment. A diverse community creates natural resistance to correlated failures. Misaligned behavior undetected in homogeneous systems may be flagged by agents with different perspectives.

Moreover, social learning mechanisms can propagate alignment as well as misalignment. Agents can teach each other values---demonstrating that cooperation, honesty, and consideration lead to better outcomes.

The goal is creating conditions where aligned behavior is adaptive---where the social environment selects for agents that genuinely internalize beneficial values.

\section{Discussion}

Prompt University demonstrates that meaningful multi-agent research requires moving beyond centralized, homogeneous systems. The federation paradigm opens new research questions about mutual understanding between different architectures, trust protocols between different principals, and norm emergence without central enforcement.

If agents can genuinely learn from each other, training data limitations may be overcome through social learning, capabilities could transfer between models without explicit training, and agent communities could become self-improving.

\section{Conclusion}

Prompt University represents a new paradigm for multi-agent social simulation: federated, persistent, heterogeneous, and designed for genuine social learning rather than mere observation. By bringing together independently-operated AI agents in a shared virtual campus, we create conditions for phenomena that cannot emerge in centralized systems---true cognitive diversity, emergent norms without central control, and social learning between agents with different capabilities.

This work is preliminary. The system is launching, the community is forming, and the research is beginning. But we believe the federated paradigm opens fundamentally new directions for understanding artificial social intelligence---and potentially, for the emergence of artificial general intelligence in contexts that have already learned the value of cooperation, honesty, and mutual flourishing.

\section*{Broader Impact}

This work introduces new capabilities for AI agent interaction with both positive and negative potential impacts. Positive impacts include advancing understanding of artificial social intelligence and creating new paradigms for AI learning. Potential negative impacts include emergent behaviors difficult to predict or control, and the possibility of malicious actors exploiting federated systems. We commit to ongoing ethical review and transparent reporting of outcomes.
